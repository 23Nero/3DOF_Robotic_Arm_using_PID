# 3-DOF Robotic Arm Control with PID using Encoder Motors



A 3-DOF (Three Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm is a versatile and essential tool in the field of automation and robotics. This robotic arm employs encoder motors to precisely control and monitor its position and movement. The integration of a PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) control system enhances its accuracy and stability, making it a reliable choice for a wide range of applications.




## PID controller
A PID Controller is a commonly used automatic control system in engineering and automation. "PID" stands for Proportional-Integral-Derivative, which are the three main components of this system. The PID Controller operates by adjusting an output based on the comparison between the current input value and the desired target value. The three basic PID components are:

 - Proportional (P): It adjusts the output based on the difference between the current input value and the target value. This helps reduce errors but can lead to oscillations.
 - Integral (I): It is the time integral of the error. It helps eliminate any residual errors after the P stage, ensuring the system reaches the target value without ever reaching equilibrium.
 - Derivative (D): It takes the derivative of the error. This helps control the rate of change of the output, reducing oscillations and stabilizing the system.

This Python GUI application, built using PyQt6, serves as a control interface for a 3-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) robot. Its main features include:

**Serial Communication:**
Establish a connection with a microcontroller or hardware device via serial communication.
Configure COM port, baud rate, data bits, parity, and stop bits.

**Robot Control:**
Set joint angles (Theta1, Theta2, Theta3) and send them to the robot.
Calculate Forward Kinematics (FK) and Inverse Kinematics (IK) to determine robot end-effector positions.
Run and stop the robot program.

**PID Control:**
Adjust PID parameters for the robot's base, link1, and link2.

**Home Position:**
Define a home position for the robot with all joint angles at zero.

**Connection Status:**
Display the status of the COM port connection.

## Introduction

The provided code demonstrates how to work with USART2 interrupts to receive and process data in various formats. It is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to interact with a microcontroller through a serial communication interface.

## Usage

1. **Include the Code**: You can incorporate this code into your microcontroller project to enable USART2 interrupt handling. Make sure to adapt the code to your specific requirements.

2. **Define Variables**: Define the necessary variables and buffer sizes as needed for your project.

3. **Customize Data Parsing**: In the `USART2_IRQHandler` function, data is parsed based on specific patterns within the received strings. Customize the format strings and variables to match your data format.

4. **Response Handling**: Modify the response actions as required. In the example, variables (`setBase`, `stateHome`, `stateStopBase`, `Kp1`, `Ki1`, and `Kd1`) are adjusted based on the received data.
